Project Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------

FracTool is a personal application for generating fractal
images. It will mainly be used by individuals for the
purposes of creating such images for use in wallpapers,
banner images for social media, creative image assets, etc.

FracTool will _not_ implement a web solution, and will _not_
expose an API for use in other programs.
